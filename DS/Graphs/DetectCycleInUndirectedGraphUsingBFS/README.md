Given an undirected graph with V vertices labeled from 0 to V-1. The graph is represented using an adjacency list where adj[i] lists all nodes connected to node. Determine if the graph contains any cycles.

Note: The graph does not contain any self-edges (edges where a vertex is connected to itself).


Examples:
Input: V = 6, adj= [[1, 3], [0, 2, 4], [1, 5], [0, 4], [1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]

Output: True

Explanation: The graph contains a cycle: 0 ->1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4 -> 1.
