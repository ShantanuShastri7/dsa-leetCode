Given an adjacency list, adj of Directed Graph, Find the number of strongly connected components in the graph.
 

Examples :

Input: adj[][] = [[2, 3], [0], [1], [4], []]

Output: 3
Explanation: We can clearly see that there are 3 Strongly Connected Components in the Graph.
 
Input: adj[][] = [[1], [2], [0]]

Output: 1
Explanation: All of the nodes are connected to each other. So, there's only one SCC.
Input: adj[][] = [[1], []]
Output: 2
Constraints:
2<=adj.size()<=106
0<=edges<=adj.size()-1
